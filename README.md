# The Joy Campaign Dashboard
- This is a project I've done for one of my classes, using the data of the World Hapiness Report. The World Hapiness Report is a report by the UN that gathers ratings of countries' citizens to their own living conditions and how it contributes to their hapiness.
- This report was built on the base that I am representing an NGO and helping them make decisions on where they should help based on the most needy. I used the data to determine the poorest countries in terms of quality of life, and to determine the richest countries that the NGO could possibly work with to gather charity money to supply to those in need.
- Each graph represents what the countries in need and at the end I showcase where the NGO can start fundraising in.
- I put a focus on developing simple and understandle graphs for everyone to understand while following the best standards of data visualization.
- The original dashboard can be found in this repo.
